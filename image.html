<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>A Test Drive of six C GUI Toolkits</H1>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>Martin Guy<BR>&lt;martinwguy&#64;gmail.com></P>
<HR>
I needed to pick a C GUI Toolkit and, being new to GUI programming,
thought I'd try implementing a few extremely simple apps in a range
of them and see which came out shortest and which easiest.

<H2>Primacies</H2>
<UL>
 <LI>Shortest code length anong the fully-working ones:
     ELM at 1800 bytes followed by AGAR and SDL2 at 2600 and 2700.
 <LI>Fastest image-zooming rate: SDL2 followed by ELM.
</UL>

<H2>The Candidates</H2>
* <A HREF=#AGAR>AGAR</A>: PUC-Rio's in-house one. Easy and pleasant to program.
Hard to learn as the only doc is a reference manual; almost no tutorials or
examples. Our code to make it work is short (2633 bytes). Buggy.
* <A HREF=#ELM>ELM: "Elementary" from the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries.
Docs patchy.  Simple stuff was easy, anything else is difficult to get right. 
Fast and robust once it's right.  Portable to mobile devices.
* <A HREF=#EVAS>"Ecore_Evas" from the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries,
a lower-level interface. Not working yet.
* <A HREF=#FLTK>FLTK: Not implemented yet.
* <A HREF=#GTK2>GTK2: Long-winded. Buggy.
* <A HREF=#GTK3>GTK3: I had to jump through strange hoops to get it to work.
* <A HREF=#IUP>IUP: Another one from PUC-Rio.
* <A HREF=#QT>In C++. Short. Not fully working yet.
* <A HREF=#SDL1>SDL1.2: No Menu/File selector stuff. No built-in image scaler
so we use libswscaler.
* <A HREF=#SDL2>SDL2: No Menu/File selector stuff.

<H1>Remarks</H1>

<H2 name=AGAR>AGAR</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="agar.png" WIDTH= HEIGHT=
     ALT="App window in AGAR on X">
A strange and rare GUI toolkit from PUC-Rio. You have to install it from
source code as it's not packaged in Debian/Ubuntu yet. The documentation
consists of a reference manual but the code needed to get things done
turns out to be refreshingly short. It compiles for Window, Mac and Linux
and has libraries for vector graphic, math with optimised matrix and geometry,
audio output and threading (mutexes, object locking and wait/signal).
<P>
Its audio capabilities are limited to reading files into RAM with libsndfile
and spitting a buffer of samples at the audio output device.
<P>
Bugs/Features:
<UL>
 <LI>The menus don't close when you move off them or press Esc.
 <LI>on rare occasions it displays the image with its top left corner
in the center of the window.
 <LI>The image-resizing speed is acceptable but it uses the sparkly resizing
algorithm.
 <LI>Its sound-playing interface is a joke, good only for going "boing".
</UL>

<H2 name=EFL>EFL</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="efl.png" WIDTH= HEIGHT=
     ALT="App window in EFL">
My second try was with the one of the most recent toolkits, the Englightenment
Foundation Library. In the same way that GTK grew out of the GIMP image editor,
EFL grew out of the Enlightenment window manager/desktop.
The app should work on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android and iPhone.
<P>
To my surprise, despite a dearth of patchy documentation and few examples,
the first example program was working in a couple of hours.
To my even greater surprise, getting the second example to work,
the one with a File-Open/Quit menu bar above the image, took
days and days and still isn't working properly so I'm not sure what's
going on.
<P>
The zoomed image is of superb quality (it looks like its algorithm is
the same as GTK's), zooming smoothly as the window is resized.
<P>
EFL's base-level audio library, Ecore_audio, is too limited.
"Emotion" instead wrapping gstreamer, xine and vlc for audio/video playback,
and has the "I've just finished playing the last buffer" events we need.
Documentation/examples are almost nonexistent; you have to read the source.
The only availableexample sudio-playing program needs e18, but Debian/Ubuntu
are still at e17.

<H2 name=GTK2>GTK2</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="gtk2.png" WIDTH= HEIGHT=
     ALT="App window in GTK2">
"The Big One". Old and crusty, detailed documentation, examples and wisdom
are abundant. I banged my head against GTK2 for two or three days before
succeeding in getting it to work.
<P>
The resized image quality is excellent, the speed acceptable but a little laggy.
<H2 name=GTK3>GTK3</H2>
<!--<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="gtk3.png" WIDTH= HEIGHT=
     ALT="App window in GTK3">-->
"The Even Bigger One". The "deprecated" window-sizing-strategy call that
we used in GTK2 to be able to shrink the window has now been removed.
The trick with GTK3 instead is to put the image in a rare kind of
invisible container.
<P>
GTK2 and 3 have a bug in common: if you scale an image down by a large factor,
the "wotsit tables" bloat out to 900MB of active RAM and it has a 100% CPU
epileptic fit lasting tens of seconds. The code here has workarounds for the
worst cases and a better workaround should appear from upstream sooner or later.
See https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=80925

<H2 name=IUP>IUP.2</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="agar.png" WIDTH= HEIGHT=
     ALT="App window in IUP on the X Window System">
Another strange and rare GUI toolkit from PUC-Rio or, rather, a collection
of graphic libraries by different authors that stack to provide a GUI toolkit.
<P>
Its image-resizing down-scaler is of rough quality, producing sparkly visible
artifacts when resizing the image very small, a defect shared with SDL2 and .
Its image resizer is also slow, managing
down to three or four window refreshes per second at large image size, goes
sparkly at high reduction factors and is even more prone than GTK to going into
paxoxysms of catatonic 100% CPU usage for tens of seconds at high image
reductions.
<P>
IUP doesn't have an audio layer of its own, so choose!

<H2 name=SDL1>SDL1.2</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="sdl1.png" WIDTH= HEIGHT=
     ALT="App window in SDL 1.2">
SDL isn't a GUI toolkit; it's a drawing library. For the simple test program
it has the smallest code, the smallest executable and the fastest/smoothest
image scaling. If you want anything more, you have to draw everything yourself
or run it from keystrokes. SDL1 doesn't have an image scaler, so we use
the swscaler library, which results slow and laggy.

<H2 name=SDL2>SDL2</H2>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="sdl2.png" WIDTH= HEIGHT=
     ALT="App window in SDL 2">
As above, except that it now has its own image scaler. This is the
only implementation of image example program 1 to be fast and have no bugs
though its image scaler goes sparkly at high reduction factors.
