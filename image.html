I need to pick a C GUI Toolkit for a project and
thought I'd try implementing some simple apps in a range
of them and see which came out shortest/easiest/best.

A strange and rare GUI toolkit from PUC-Rio. The documentation
consists of just a reference manual but the code needed to get things done
turns out to be refreshingly short. It compiles for Windows, Mac and Linux.
On Debian/Ubuntu you need to install it from the source code.
<P>
Bugs/Features:
<UL>
 <LI>The menus don't close when you move off them or press Esc.
 <LI>It has a minimum window size of 32x32
 <LI>On rare occasions it opens the image with its top left corner
in the center of the window.
 <LI><A HREF="https://bugs.csoft.net/show_bug.cgi?id=226">When resizing
     using a corner other than the bottom right one, it sometimes gets
     the image position wrong</A>.
 <LI>The image-resizing speed is acceptable but it uses a poor resizing
     algorithm.
 <LI><A HREF="https://bugs.csoft.net/show_bug.cgi?id=227">The image is sometimes displayed skewed by 34 or 45 degrees or in greyscale</A>.
 <LI>If you open an image wider than the desktop and move the window left,
     the newly-exposed area is all gray.
 <LI>See the top of image-agar.c for even more bugs in AGAR.
     Since reporting some of these bugs weeks ago there has been no response
     or activity from its maintainer.

     ALT="image1 in ELM on X">
The "Elementary" GUI toolkit of the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries.
Runs on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android and iOS and is the native GTK for Tizen.
<P>
Despite big holes in the documentation and few examples,
the first example program was working in a couple of hours.
The second example, with a File-Open/Quit menu bar above the image, took
days to get right. Fast and robust once it's right.
<P>
The zoomed image is of superb quality (it looks like its algorithm is
the same as GTK's), zooming smoothly as the window is resized.
<P>
It requires the least lines of code, of the ones that work.

Old and crusty, detailed documentation, examples and wisdom
are abundant. I banged my head against GTK2 for two or three days before
succeeding in getting it to work. Despite its age, it is buggy.
<P>
You have to rescale the image explicitly at every window resize in a callback.
The resized image quality is excellent and the speed acceptable if laggy.

"The Even Bigger One". More interlinked web documentation, examples and
forum snippets even than GTK2.
<P>
Unfortunately, the deprecated set-window-sizing-strategy call that we used in
GTK2 to make the window shrink has been removed.
A bizarre trick that works with GTK3 is to put the image inside a rare kind of
invisible container on which you set some properties. Gak!
<P>
GTK2 and 3 have <A HREF="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=80925">a
14-year-old bug in common</A>: if you scale an image down by a large factor,
the "filter tables" bloat out to 900MB of active RAM and it has a 100% CPU
epileptic fit lasting tens of seconds. The code here has workarounds for the
worst cases and I've submitted a better workaround to the maintainers of
the affected library, gdk-pixbuf. However, instead of fixing it or helping,
they seem more intent on raising one silly objection after the other.
That would explain why GTK is still full of bugs!

Another strange and rare GUI toolkit from PUC-Rio or, rather, a collection
of graphic libraries by different authors that stack to provide a GUI toolkit.
<P>
Bugs:
<UL>
 <LI>Its image-resizing down-scaler is of rough quality, producing sparkly
visible artifacts when resizing small.
 <LI>It is even more prone than GTK to going into paxoxysms of catatonic
100% CPU usage for tens of seconds at high image reductions.

SDL isn't a GUI toolkit; it's a drawing library. For the simple test program
it has the smallest code and the smallest executable.
If you want anything more, you have to draw everything yourself
and pilot it by keystrokes. SDL1 doesn't have an image scaler of its own,
so we use the swscale library, which results in laggy operation.
<P>
Although this is the oldest software of them all, it is well maintained and
successfully adapted to modern displays. If you want buttons, menus etc,
you have to draw them yourself.

As above, except that it now has its own image scaler.
Its scaling is the fastest but its scaler is nearest-neighbour
so it goes sparkly at small sizes.
<P>
Like SDL1, you have to draw user-interface items yourself.

<U>Legend</U><BR>
<UL>
 <LI><I>Nearest:</I>
A poor-quality fast scaling algorithm that makes the image
sparkle when you resize it at high downscaling, and blocky when much enlarged.
 <LI><I>Bilinear:</I>
A better-quality scaling algorithm produces smooth output when enlarging
and when reducing.
 <LI><I>swscale:</I>
A separate library specialising in scaling images in software.
