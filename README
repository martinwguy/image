Here are two simple image file viewers written in different C GUI toolkits:
AGAR, Enlightenment's ELM and Ecore_Evas, GTK2 and 3, IUP, SDL1 and 2.

The program image1 is given the image file as a command-line argument
with a default of image.jpg.
The window should open fitting the image at one screen pixel per image pixel.
The user can then resize the window and the image scales to fit the window
without keeping its aspect ratio.
If they hit Control-Q or poke the [X] icon in the window's titlebar,
the application should quit.

image2 is the same but has a File-Open/Quit menu bar above the image.

See image.html for how they fared.
