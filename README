Here is the same simple image file viewer written in ten C GUI toolkits:
AGAR, Enlightenment's ELM and Ecore_Evas interfaces, GTK2 and 3, FLTK,
IUP, QT4, SDL1 and SDL2.

The first example program is given the image file as a command-line argument
with a default of image.jpg.
The window should open to exactly fit the image at one-pixel-per-pixel size.
The user can then resize the window and the image scales to fit the window
without keeping its aspect ratio.
If they hit Control-Q or poke the [X] icon in the window's titlebar,
the application should quit.

A second example, image2, has a File-Open/Quit menu bar above the image.

AGAR:	On Debian/Ubuntu you have to install it from the source code.
	There only seems to be a reference manual.
	The few random "tutorials" posted on the web in 2015 are in non-working
	web containers giving just indices of directory contents and consist
	of Markdown files in *.htm files.
	Its mailing list, existing since 2007, has never had more than
	11 kbytes of messages in any one month. To see the bugs in their
	bugzilla you have to register, and the activation email contains a
	broken link.
	AG_ScaleSurface is limited to Uint16 dimensions which I suppose is
	better than Cairo's 32767...
	It has audio support and its thread support may be useful for
	calculang FFTs in the background.

ELM:	The Enlightenment Foundation Library. Despite the extremely patchy
	documentation and rndo selection of code examples, image1 was working
	in under an hour. image2, adding a menu bar above the image, took days.
	The result is fast and good quality and the code it needs is the
	shortest by far.

EVAS:	A lower level of the Enlightenment Foundation library.
	Doesn't work properly yet.

GTK2:	Big and old, lots of documentation, tutorials and code examples on the
	web. Should be stable, complete and well-maintained.
	It took me two days to get image1 working. You have rescale the image
	explicitly at every window resize in a callback by calling one of its
	functions to do this for you.
	When I resize down to 1x1 and up again, it goes into a 100% CPU loop
	for dozens of seconds, then recovers and starts working again without
	being prodded, as mysteriously as it went into paralysis.  I see that
	one of the simple open source GTK image viewers in Debian has exactly
	the same bug.

GTK3:	Similar. Had to jump through strange hoops to get it to work.

FLTK:	An attempted implementation, not finished yet.

IUP:	Another GUI toolkit from PUC-Rio, like AGAR.

QT4:	An attempted implementation in C++, not finished yet.

SDL1: 	Lower-level, like EVAS. Small, short code and fast.
SDL2:
