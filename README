Here are two simple image file viewers written in different C GUI toolkits:
AGAR, Enlightenment's ELM and Ecore_Evas interfaces, GTK2 and 3, IUP, SDL1 and 2.

image1 is given the image file as a command-line argument
with a default of image.jpg.
The window should open to exactly fit the image at one-pixel-per-pixel size.
The user can then resize the window and the image scales to fit the window
without keeping its aspect ratio.
If they hit Control-Q or poke the [X] icon in the window's titlebar,
the application should quit.

image2 is the same but has a File-Open/Quit menu bar above the image.

See image.html for details.
